This is a web-based 3D viewer for *.pcf files (Piping Component File).

    Load one or multiple PCF files via file picker or drag-and-drop

    Click any component to display its metadata straight from its source file

    Toggle visibility of individual pipelines and component types using on-screen checkboxes

All rendering and interaction happen entirely in the browser—no server-side processing required. Simply load your PCF, explore your piping network in 3D, and inspect component details.

The project is still under active development—more features coming soon.
